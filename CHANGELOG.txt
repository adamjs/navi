Current Version: NaviLibrary v1.3

API Changes since v1.2:
- In NaviManager:
-- NaviManager::bindNaviData has been added
-- NaviManager::unbindNaviData has been added
-- NaviManager::hideNavi has been added
-- NaviManager::showNavi has been added
-- NaviManager::getNaviVisibility has been added
-- NaviManager::createNavi and createNaviMaterial have been extended, a new parameter 'isVisible'
-- NaviManager::createNavi has been refactored to use a unified NaviPosition object

Core Changes since v1.2:
- Callbacks via a delegate has been added thanks to freely available 'FastDelegate' code, (see NaviDelegate.h for more info)
- Fading via hideNavi/showNavi has been implemented. The fading algorithm respects 'maxUpdatesPS' and also does not invoke needless Gecko draw calls. You can set a duration for the fade (in milliseconds) as well.
- In the case of non-NaviMaterial Navis, when the visibility of a Navi is false, the overlay will be hidden as well and vice-versa. All non-visible Navis will not needlessly update their internal texture.
- Rewrote much of the overlay/coordinate derivations for use with the new NaviPosition object. Relatively-positioned Navis can now be specified with an optional left/top offset.

Bugfixes since v1.2:
- In OpenGL, the NaviMouse cursors were showing corruption. Apparently because the manual texture of each cursor was loaded from an image, in OpenGL the hardwarepixelbuffer is created in Write-mode only and thus we cannot lock it to read it and instead must copy it.
- Added some protection against adding a NaviEventListener twice.
- Fixed destruction of a Navi called within an event spawned by the Navi object itself. Now, NaviManager::destroyNavi only flags the Navi for deletion, the actual destruction is done in NaviManager::update.
- Fixed small bug with destroying a Navi that was currently focused.

Bugfixes since v1.1:
- There was an issue with the destruction of the Navi object, specifically I didn't destroy the OverlayContainer before the Overlay. This has been resolved thanks to madmark's notification of the issue.
