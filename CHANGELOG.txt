Current Version: NaviLibrary v1.3

API Changes since v1.2:
- In NaviManager:
-- NaviManager::bindNaviData has been added

Bugfixes since v1.2:
- In OpenGL, the NaviMouse cursors were showing corruption. Apparently because the manual texture of each cursor was loaded from an image, in OpenGL the hardwarepixelbuffer is created in Write-mode only and thus we cannot lock it to read it and instead must copy it.
- Added some protection against adding a NaviEventListener twice.

-- NaviManager::getNaviMaterialName has been added

Bugfixes since v1.1:
- There was an issue with the destruction of the Navi object, specifically I didn't destroy the OverlayContainer before the Overlay. This has been resolved thanks to madmark's notification of the issue.
