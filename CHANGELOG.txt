Current Version: NaviLibrary v1.5

API Changes since v1.4:
- In NaviManager:
-- NaviManager::GetPointer has been added
-- NaviManager::Startup has been merged into the constructor for NaviManager.
-- You must instantiate (new NaviManager(renderWin)) NaviManager before accessing the singleton via NaviManager::Get/NaviManager::GetPointer.
- In the VC8 Solution:
-- Two new configurations: Release DLL and Debug DLL. If you intend to use these configurations, you must define the preprocessor macro 'NAVI_DYNAMIC_LIB' in your application, link to 'Navi_DLL.lib' (use 'Navi_d_DLL.lib' for debug), and copy 'Navi.dll' (use 'Navi_d.dll' for debug) to your application's working directory.

Core Changes since v1.4:
- New template class 'NaviLibrary::Singleton' has been created to make the NaviManager Singleton safer and more manageable. It is mostly a carbon-copy of Ogre's Singleton except with different accessors (Singleton::Get()/Singleton::GetPointer()) and verbose exceptions.
- DLL support!


Current Version: NaviLibrary v1.4

API Changes since v1.3:
- In NaviManager:
-- NaviManager::StartupMouse has a new, optional 'visible' parameter
-- NaviManager::moveNavi has been added
-- NaviManager::setNaviPosition has been added
-- NaviManager::setNaviIgnoreBounds has been added
-- NaviManager::bindNaviData & unbindNaviData have now been renamed bind & unbind, respectively.
-- NaviManager::bind has a new optional parameter, a string vector containing keys to validate via NaviData::ensure.
-- NaviManager::getDerivedUV has been added.
-- NaviManager::injectNaviMaterialMouseWheel has been renamed injectNaviMouseWheel because it may now be used on both regular Navis and NaviMaterials.
-- NaviManager::setNaviBackgroundColor has a new overload (takes a hex color string).
-- NaviManager::focusNavi has a new public overload (a private func by the same name exists) to focus a Navi by name.
- In NaviData:
-- Completely rewritten with an std::map as a base with heavy use of a generic type, 'NaviDataValue'.
-- Primary mode of interface is via the subscript operator (naviData["myKey"]) for assignment/value retrieval.
-- NaviData::ensure may be used for validation purposes.
- In NaviMouse:
-- NaviMouse::show() has been added
-- NaviMouse::hide() has been added
-- NaviManager::injectNaviMaterialMouseMove has been renamed injectNaviMouseMove and now works for both NaviMaterials and regular Navis
-- NaviManager::injectNaviMaterialMouseWheel has been renamed injectNaviMouseWheel and now works for both NaviMaterials and regular Navis
-- NaviManager::injectNaviMaterialMouseDown has been renamed injectNaviMouseDown and now works for both NaviMaterials and regular Navis
-- NaviManager::injectNaviMaterialMouseUp has been renamed injectNaviMouseUp and now works for both NaviMaterials and regular Navis
- In NaviUtilities:
-- Is now wrapped in a new nested namespace, NaviUtilities
-- New functions: split, splitToMap, join, joinFromMap, isPrefixed, isNumeric, numberToString, toNumber
-- New utility class, InlineVector<T> and specialization, Strings
-- NaviUtilities::replaceAll has lost a parameter, 'avoidCyclic' (no longer required due to new implementation)
- In Navi.js:
-- Completely rewritten from the ground up. Mootools v1.11 is embedded in the first section, scroll to the bottom section for the actual meat of Navi.js.
-- New combobox implementation has been included as a workaround for the current problems with native comboboxes.
-- Element.setHTMLBuffered has been included as a workaround for the flicker problem with frequently-updated elements.

Core Changes since v1.3:
- Navi::update() is now mindful of machine-specific bit depths/rowspans. This contribution/bugfix was made possible by 'madmark'.
- Before now, if you clicked and dragged on a button and released the mouse outside of the Navi, the mouse-up event would never have been passed. This has been fixed, if a user releases the left mouse button outside of a previously-focused Navi, the mouse-up event will be invoked on the nearest valid point on a Navi (Gecko won't accept extraneous input)
- If a user wishes, mouse movement can always be injected into a Navi, regardless of boundaries/transparency via 'NaviManager::setNaviIgnoreBounds'. The extra-boundary mouse movement injection will actually occur on the closest valid point of a Navi.
- Navis can now be set to arbitrary sizes, there is no power-of-two limitation anymore. Certain legacy videocards that do not support NPOT textures will be detected and internally compensated for (using the next highest POT size and adjusting UVs). Those that use NaviMaterials should be aware of this fallback mechanism and adjust their own UV's accordingly.
- Fading via hideNavi/showNavi has received a quite noticeable performance boost.
- Much code has been refactored and minified thanks to several new utility functions (split/splitToMap/join/joinFromMap).
- NaviData and Navi.js has been completely rewritten.
- Fixed some const-correctness

Bugfixes since v1.3:
- There was a memory read exception on certain systems due to assumptions about bit depths, this has been resolved.
- Occasionally there are assertions when exiting an application in debug-mode (Gecko bug 339504). Clearing the cache before shutting down seems to help in certain situations. This was contributed by 'Lord LoriK'.
- If you hid a Navi with a fade and then tried to show the Navi without a fade, auto-updated Navis will not be visible because the texture wasn't updated (it would still have 0% opacity). This has been resolved.
- There was a conflict with madmark's contribution, specifically superfluous width offsets being calculated that offset the blitting of non-POT sizes enough to malform them and cause several memory read exceptions. This has been resolved.
- There was an issue with the use of alpha-masks on Navis smaller than the mask, specifically incorrect pitches being calculated. This has been resolved.
- NaviUtilities::decodeURIComponent previously failed to properly decode certain sequences, this has been resolved.
- There was a fairly critical bug with the instantiation and sizing of naviCache (caches the texture data for each Navi), it was using a fairly fixed formula (width*height*pixelSize) which incorrectly predicted the size of the texture data on some video cards. This issue has been resolved.
- A related issue to the above bug was found in the alpha-picking code (Navi::isPointOpaqueEnough) and has been resolved.

Current Version: NaviLibrary v1.3

API Changes since v1.2:
- In NaviManager:
-- NaviManager::bindNaviData has been added
-- NaviManager::unbindNaviData has been added
-- NaviManager::hideNavi has been added
-- NaviManager::showNavi has been added
-- NaviManager::getNaviVisibility has been added
-- NaviManager::createNavi and createNaviMaterial have been extended, a new parameter 'isVisible'
-- NaviManager::createNavi has been refactored to use a unified NaviPosition object
- In NaviData:
-- NaviData::add has been extended for wide-string support
-- NaviData::get has been extended for wide-string support
- In NaviUtilities:
-- NaviUtilities::encodeURIComponent has been added
-- NaviUtilities::decodeURIComponent has been added
-- NaviUtilities::toWide has been added
-- NaviUtilities::toMultibyte has been added
-- NaviUtilities::setLocale has been added
- In Navi.js:
-- Navi.js::NaviData::addQS has been added
-- Navi.js::NaviData add(), addQS(), send() now return a reference to the NaviData object itself, thus you can do chaining (new NaviData('whatever').add('something', 'value').send())
-- Navi.js::decode()/encode() have been removed because now we use encodeURIComponent()/decodeURIComponent() natively

Core Changes since v1.2:
- Callbacks via a delegate has been added thanks to freely available 'FastDelegate' code, (see NaviDelegate.h for more info)
- Fading via hideNavi/showNavi has been implemented. The fading algorithm respects 'maxUpdatesPS' and also does not invoke needless Gecko draw calls. You can set a duration for the fade (in milliseconds) as well.
- In the case of non-NaviMaterial Navis, when the visibility of a Navi is false, the overlay will be hidden as well and vice-versa. All non-visible Navis will not needlessly update their internal texture.
- Rewrote much of the overlay/coordinate derivations for use with the new NaviPosition object. Relatively-positioned Navis can now be specified with an optional left/top offset.
- Revised encoding/decoding in Navi.js and application-side to use the proper method of decoding/encoding data to percent-escaped UTF-8 encoded hexadecimal sequences. The excellent side effect of this is that we now have true unicode support. The two functions 'encodeURIComponent' and 'decodeURIComponent' exist in Javascript but not in C++ and so I wrote a mirror-implementation in C++ for use in our own context. To implement it, I needed a lightweight, cross-platform UTF-8 encoding/decoding library; thus UTF8-CPP is a new dependency.

Bugfixes since v1.2:
- In OpenGL, the NaviMouse cursors were showing corruption. Apparently because the manual texture of each cursor was loaded from an image, in OpenGL the hardwarepixelbuffer is created in Write-mode only and thus we cannot lock it to read it and instead must copy it.
- Added some protection against adding a NaviEventListener twice.
- Fixed destruction of a Navi called within an event spawned by the Navi object itself. Now, NaviManager::destroyNavi only flags the Navi for deletion, the actual destruction is done in NaviManager::update.
- Fixed small bug with destroying a Navi that was currently focused.
- Fixed a parsing bug in NaviData.cpp, the problem was only apparent with NaviData objects with multiple parameters.

Extras since v1.2:
- New NaviDemo! Check it out for ideas/tips on how to implement the NaviLibrary in your own game.
