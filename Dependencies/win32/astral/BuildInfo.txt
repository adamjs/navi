Astral build: May 27th, 2008

Steps taken to create SDK
- Build Astral in Debug & Release
- In SDK directory, create 3 folders: include, lib, and runtime
- Copy Astral.h and BrowserWindow.h from Astral\Astral\include to include folder
- Copy Astral.lib, Astral_d.lib, and astral_d.pdb from Astral\Astral\lib to lib folder
- In runtime directory, create 2 folders: debug and release
- Copy everything from Astral\xulrunner-1.8-win32\runtime_debug to the debug folder
- Copy everything from Astral\xulrunner-1.8-win32\runtime_release to the release folder
- For both the debug and release folders, create a new folder called "GeckoRuntime" within each
